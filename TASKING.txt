TARGET FOR DEFENSE
	- UI / UX
		* rotate options
		* splashscreen image
	- Functions
		* fix bugs
		* esc button to CANCEL resize
		* limit resizer (confirm min and max)
		* save image (BOTH DEVICE)
		* at least 1 or 2 new tools
		* grid auto straight
		* zoom (i hope)
	- Research
		* study git
		* filename extension
		* build for both apps
		* recent files
		* opening image file
		* finalize tools to implement
		* share image file
